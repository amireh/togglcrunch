          <p>Since we've just had lunch together, you should tag the expense as a
          Food expense.</p> <p><em>Tip: you can choose more than one tag when it makes
          sense.</em></p> <p>Just like currencies and payment methods, you can customize
          your tags in your <a href="/settings/tags">settings</a>.

        <p>Congratulations! You've now added the expense to your activity feed.</p>
        <p>Double-clicking on the transaction allows you to edit or remove it, using
        the editor we just learned how to use.</p> <p><em>On mobile and tablet, you
        can perform a swipe gesture to the left or right instead of clicking.</em></p>
